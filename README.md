# Music Drill Sergeant

## Project Description:

Many music students struggle with perfecting their musical note-reading skills. As the old wisdom says: "The practice makes it perfect", the goal of this project is to develop a skeleton prototype application that will help perfect the musical notes sight reading on acoustic guitar. The student learning technique will be similar to the flashcards learning technique, where the student will be presented with a musical note and the student needs to play it on the guitar. The computer will recognize the note and judge was the note learned or not. Poorly learned notes will be shown to the student more often. The key component will be computer musical notes recognition system. We will go a full cycle on it: 1) sample collection, 2) model training and 3) model utilization within the note drill. Here we will limit ourselves only to acoustic guitar.
